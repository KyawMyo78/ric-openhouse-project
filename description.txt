PROJECT TITLE:
Rock Paper Scissors AI Emotion Detector

SHORT DESCRIPTION:
An intelligent Rock Paper Scissors game that combines computer vision, AI emotion detection, and real-time hand gesture recognition to create an interactive gaming experience that responds to your facial expressions.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
This innovative project transforms the classic Rock Paper Scissors game into an AI-powered interactive experience. Using advanced computer vision techniques, the application detects hand gestures in real-time to recognize Rock, Paper, and Scissors moves while simultaneously analyzing facial expressions to determine the player's emotional state. The game features adaptive UI scaling that automatically adjusts to different camera resolutions, multi-camera support with interactive selection, and emotion-based responses that change based on whether you're happy, sad, surprised, sleepy, or neutral. The system includes a professional countdown timer, landmark visualization toggle for debugging, and cross-platform audio feedback. Built with MediaPipe for landmark detection and OpenCV for computer vision processing, this project demonstrates practical applications of AI in gaming and human-computer interaction.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
• Python 3.7+ - Core programming language
• OpenCV 4.8.1 - Computer vision and camera handling
• MediaPipe 0.10.7 - Hand and facial landmark detection
• NumPy - Numerical computing for data processing
• Computer Vision - Real-time image processing
• Machine Learning - Gesture and emotion recognition algorithms
• Cross-platform Audio - Windows (winsound) and Linux/Mac (os.system)
• Git - Version control
• GitHub - Repository hosting

PROJECT IMAGE IDEAS/SUGGESTIONS:
1. MAIN SHOWCASE IMAGE:
   - Split-screen showing player making rock gesture on left, game interface on right
   - Overlay showing detected emotion ("HAPPY") and gesture recognition
   - Visible landmarks on face and hand for technical demonstration
   - Professional UI with score display and countdown timer

2. FEATURE DEMONSTRATION GRID:
   - Four panels showing different emotions (Happy, Sad, Surprised, Sleepy)
   - Each panel shows the detected facial expression with corresponding game response
   - Clean, professional layout with consistent lighting

3. TECHNICAL WORKFLOW DIAGRAM:
   - Flow chart: Camera Input → Face/Hand Detection → Emotion/Gesture Analysis → Game Logic → UI Response
   - Include MediaPipe and OpenCV logos
   - Show adaptive UI scaling for different resolutions

4. MULTI-CAMERA SETUP SCREENSHOT:
   - Terminal interface showing camera selection menu
   - Multiple resolution options displayed
   - Professional command-line interface design

5. GAMEPLAY SEQUENCE:
   - Time-lapse style images showing: Face Detection → Countdown → Gesture → Result → Emotion Response
   - Action shots with visible landmarks and UI overlays

6. BEFORE/AFTER COMPARISON:
   - Traditional Rock Paper Scissors vs AI-Enhanced version
   - Highlight emotion detection and adaptive features
